## About This Project

**Dish Dash** is a cooking game inspired by "*Overcooked*" and developed with **Unity 3D**. The objective is to cook and serve as many recipes as possible within a fixed time limit.

​Players must manage their time wisely and act fast since they will be performing various culinary tasks such as cutting ingredients, cooking meat, and plating dishes.

​The game is compatible with both keyboard and controller inputs, offering players the choice of their preferred control method.
